# Ferocious-Fruits
For the BU Code Jam 2024, our team the Ferocious Fruits has made a resource management game using Unity. Our game lets you run the univeresity for an entire year where you can take control of how the budget is spent and balance how that will affect different factors like student satisfaction and emission levels
